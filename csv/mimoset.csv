Sequencing of positives identified a short disulfide-constrained loop CFG(W/Y/F)C as a well-defined consensus motif. A peptide with the sequence DVPCFGWCQDA (referred to as paionin-1 hereafter) was synthesized. The paionin-1 sequence is a chimaera of clones A (CDPPCFGWCQDAC) and B (CDVPCFGWCVAWC) devoid of the flanking cysteine residues, which might be not essential as indicated by the clone G (ILCFGMC). The paionin-1 peptide inhibited the PAI-1 binding of phage clone B, while a linear version paionin-1 with the two cysteine residues replaced by serines had no effect on binding. This suggested that the constraint imposed by the disulfide locked the CFGWC loop in a conformation required for binding or that the cysteines were of contact residues. The binding of paionin-1 to PAI-1 was evaluated further through competition experiments with vitronectin. The results showed that vitronectin significantly inhibited the binding of paionin-1 to PAI-1.

Under the most stringent conditions examined, 11 of the 100 substrate phage, containing eight distinct randomized hexamer sequences (RKASLS, RNAQVR, RRAVSN, RSAKVD, RSANAI, RSATRD, RSAVVK and RSSSSH), proved to be particularly labile u-PA substrates. Besides, four peptides (RSANAI, RNAQVR, RSATRD and RKASLS) were chosen for detailed kinetic analysis and compared with the hydrolysis of a control peptide containing the P3–P4' sequence of plasminogen. All four of the selected peptides were substantially improved substrates for u-PA, by factors of 840–5300, compared with the control, plasminogen peptide (kcat/Km, 0.88 1/Ms).

After a final wash, the reaction was developed with the HRP substrate and quantified by reading the absorbance at 450 nm in a plate reader. The wells incubated with negative clones remained nearly colorless. The absorbance was shown. Besides, synthetic peptides representing the individual phage families were analyzed for the ability to inhibit the binding of 14G2a mAb to GD2-positive IMR-32 neuroblastoma cell. Varying amounts of the competitors were incubated overnight with 14G2a antibody (1 μg/mL). The mixtures were transferred to IMR-32 cells, and the inhibition of 14G2a binding to cellular GD2 was measured after staining with FITC-conjugated secondary antibody by flow cytometry analysis.

Nineteen phage sequences emerged multiple times after DNA sequencing (Top19 sequences). Of the 19 clones, 17 were found in more than 1 experiment on the same substrate, either BLM or HA. Of these 17 phage clones, 7 had high affinity towards both BLM and HA (Top7 sequences). Ten of the identified phage were analyzed using a modified ELISA on BLM films, HA disks, PLGA films and tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) wells at 4 phage dilutions. Low adsorption of the selected phage to TCPS and PLGA compared to HA and BLM illustrates the identified phage have specificity to apatite-based substrates. Of the 10 peptides tested, favorable phage binding was observed for all sequences except SSLGLTVSSIMY, VSPLSFGSPRYP and WSPAPHVIMGTT. On the other hand, the peptides having the highest affinity and greatest potential for adsorption on HA disks and BLM films include APWHLSSQYSRT, STLPIPHEFSRE and VTKHLNQISQSY. The peptide VTKHLNQISQSY is similar in composition to regions found in fibromodulin, lumican and decorin.

Thus, the authors inferred that dermally administered TDA1 would first access systemic circulation via hair follicles as its transdermal route and then could target visceral fat effectively. The overall results suggest that the TDA1 peptide could be potentially applied as a homing moiety for delivery of anti-obesity therapeutics to visceral fat through the convenient transdermal pathway.",NULL,NULL,NULL,0000-00-00,NULL,NO

Next, the specific binding ability of synthesized peptide A54 was further confirmed by fluorescence microscopy, competition binding, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting assay. A54 and A54M (sequence AGKGTAALETTP) were synthesized and coupled to doxorubicin (DOX) to do the preliminary targeting therapy. After the treatment, the proliferation of liver cancer cells treated with A54-DOX was restrained significantly in vitro when compared with A54M-DOX-treated group. Reduction in tumor size and prolongation of long-term survival were also found in xenograft-bearing models compared with free DOX-treated group. In conclusion, the specific binding peptide A54, which was screened from phage display library, represents a promising approach for the development of novel target therapy strategies against hepatocellular carcinoma.",ELISA,"Phage binding assay was performed by using cell-based ELISA. The absorbance at 450 nm was determined. Selectivity is calculated using the following formula: Selectivity = (ODS1-ODC1)/(ODS2-ODC2).

The phages with selectivity above 2 are considered to be positive clones. Phage clones A54, A67, and B2 seemed to have the most specific binding ability in cell-based ELISA.

Significantly, the surface with peptide-displaying phages shows much higher fluorescent intensity relative to the one incubated with M13 phages (without phage displayed peptides on the coat). Further, we investigated the localized binding of phage displayed peptide (TLHPAAD) to epoxy microstructures. The epoxy microstructures on glass were generated by using stencil masks to cover epoxy, followed by plasma oxidation. The phage displayed peptides were then allowed to bind to these epoxy microstructures, and the bindings were characterized with fluorescent characterization. Significantly, stronger fluorescent signals were observed localized on the epoxy patterns, relative to the glass substrate.

The ability of the isolated phage clone to interact specifically with S. aureus and the  efficacy of its bacteria-binding  properties were established by using enzyme linked immune-sorbent assay  (ELISA). We also demonstrated by Western blot analysis that the most reactive and selective phage peptide binds a 78 KDa protein on the bacterial cell surface. Furthermore, we observed selectivity of phage–bacteria-binding allowing to  identify clinical isolates of S. aureus in comparison with a panel of other  bacterial species. In order to explore the possibility of realizing a selective bacteria biosensor device, based on  immobilization of affinity-selected  phage, we have studied the physisorbed phage deposition onto a mica surface. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) was used to determine the organization of phage on mica surface and then the binding performance of mica-physisorbed phage to bacterial target was evaluated during the time by fluorescent microscopy. The system is able to bind specifically about 50% of S. aureus cells after 15' and 90% after one hour. Due to  specificity and rapidness, this  biosensing strategy paves the way to the further development of new cheap  biosensors to be used in developing countries, as lab-on-chip (LOC) to  detect bacterial agents in clinical diagnostics applications.

Bound phage are recovered from the cell pellet whereas the unbound phage remain soluble in the upper aqueous phase, eliminating the need for repeated washes. A two-step panning strategy to isolate phage that bind to angiogenic ECs was used. First, to decrease non-specific binding, we pre-cleared the phage library on starved ECs (before panning on the same cell line stimulated with recombinant VEGF165); starved human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs) were incubated with the phage library and centrifuged through the organic phase. Second, the unbound phage pool left in the aqueous phase was transferred to a fresh tube and incubated with VEGF165-stimulated HUVECs.

PFT exhibited preferential binding to v6A3 cells compared to parental cells. Immunohistofluorescence studies with human PCa tissue microarrays (TMA) indicated that PFT was highly accurate in detecting CD44v6 positive aggressive PCa cells, and staining positivity was significantly higher in late stage, metastatic and higher-grade samples.

A10 and protease-activated receptor 4-activating peptide (PAR4-AP, positive control) were immobilized on commercially pure titanium. The peptide-treated titanium showed high epithelial cell migration ability during incubation in platelet-rich plasma. We confirmed the development of dense and expanded BL (stained by Ln5) with pericellular junctions (stained by ZO1) on the peptide-treated titanium surface. In an adhesion assay of epithelial cells on A10-treated titanium, PAR4-AP-treated titanium, bovine root and non-treated titanium, A10-treated titanium and PAR4-AP-treated titanium showed significantly stronger adhesion than non-treated titanium. PAR4-AP-treated titanium showed significantly higher inflammatory cytokine release than non-treated titanium. There was no significant difference in inflammatory cytokine release between A10-treated and non-treated titanium. These results indicated that A10 could induce the adhesion and migration of epithelial cells with low inflammatory cytokine release. This novel peptide has a potentially useful application that could improve clinical outcomes with titanium implants and abutments by reducing or preventing peri-implant disease.",NULL,NULL,Yuwei Zhou,2018-10-20,NULL,NO
