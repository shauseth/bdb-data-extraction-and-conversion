MANP comprises 8164 bases. The bla gene was from pGEM3Zf1(+), was bound by BamHI-HindIII sites at the 5' end and HindIII-SalI sites at the 3' end, replaced bases 6001 through 6432 of M13mp18, and was in the same orientation as the phage genes. The junction between the III signal sequence and mature III was modified with an NcoI restriction site embedded in the last three codons of the signal sequence. After the III signal, MANP contained the sequence of BPTI with restriction sites for the enzymes StyI, XhoI, PflMI, ApaI, Bsp120I, EcoO109I, PspOMI, BssHII, StuI, BstZ17I, BlpI, EagI, and SphI, which were all unique within MANP. Following BPTI, a unique PstI site and a Factor Xa cleavage site were inserted in a short linker region before mature III. The DNA encoding the library was synthesized with constant DNA on either side so that the DNA could be PCR amplified using TAQ DNA polymerase, cleaved with NcoI and PstI, and ligated to similarly cleaved vector. The variegated parts were synthesized with TRIM technology, which incorporates trinucleotides and allows mixtures of any set of amino acid types in any desired proportions.

FUSE-5 replicative Form DNA was purified from K802 Escherichia coli and linearized by SfiI digestion, and the resulting vector DNA was ligated to synthetic DNA fragments containing complementary BglI termini. These duplex oligonucleotides contained (NNM)6 triplets in the coding strand, where N corresponds to equivalent amounts of A, T, G, and C and where M corresponds to equivalent amounts of G and T (minimizes occurrence of translational stop codons). The noncoding strand consisted of 18 or 45 residue stretches of the inosine nucleotide analog. Recombinant DNA was electroporated into MC1061 E. coli electrocompetent cells, spread on 94 plates (24 x 24 cm) with NZamine-yeast extract (NZY) agar plus 40 μg/ml tetracycline (tet) and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Phage were collected by polyethylene glycol precipitation and purified on cesium chloride gradients. The number of transducing units (TU) was determined by infecting K91Kan-resistant cells with an aliquot from each library and plating on tet plates. FUSE5-vector DNA containing an insert restores the reading frame of the pIII gene product, enabling the phage to infect K91Kan-resistant cells and produce colonies on tet plates."

To adapt the fth1 for Illumina deep sequencing, Illumina adaptors A and B were inserted upstream and downstream to the insert-flanking SfiI sites. Oligonucleotides corresponding to the Adaptor sequences were inserted by 'SOEing' PCR mutagenesis using the Accuzyme polymerase (Bioline, BIO-21052). Alternatively, extended PCR primers can be used to accomplish the same as has been described previously. Libraries were constructed as described below. Briefly, two 5’ biotinylated oligonucleotides were used. The first contained the redundant ""library"" sequence, e.g., 7×NNK flanked by BglI sites compatible with the two SfiI sites of the vector (61 bases). The second oligonucleotide, 18 bases, complemented the 3’ end of the first and was extended to ""fill-in"" the complementary strand using Klenow polymerase. The product was digested with BglI, the short biotinylated segments were removed with Streptavidin conjugated magnetic beads and the eluent was cloned into SfiI digested fth1-dp vector. This ligation mix was used to electroporate MC1061 or DH5alpha cells as indicated in the text."
