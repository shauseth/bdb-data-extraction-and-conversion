Each displayed peptide is followed by a short spacer (Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser) and then the wild-type pIII sequence. The display vector used for the library is a derivative of wild-type M13 phage-simple propagation of the library as phage rather than plasmid eliminates the need for antibiotic selection and a separate helper phage superinfection step, saving time and effort. Extensive sequencing of the library has revealed a wide diversity of side chains at each position with no obvious positional biases."

Smith (University of Missouri). FUSE-5 replicative Form DNA was purified from K802 Escherichia coli and linearized by SfiI digestion, and the resulting vector DNA was ligated to synthetic DNA fragments containing complementary BglI termini. These duplex oligonucleotides contained (NNM)15 triplets in the coding strand, where N corresponds to equivalent amounts of A, T, G, and C and where M corresponds to equivalent amounts of G and T (minimizes occurrence of translational stop codons). The noncoding strand consisted of 18 or 45 residue stretches of the inosine nucleotide analog. Recombinant DNA was electroporated into MC1061 E. coli electrocompetent cells, spread on 94 plates (24 x 24 cm) with NZamine-yeast extract (NZY) agar plus 40 μg/ml tetracycline (tet) and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Phage were collected by polyethylene glycol precipitation and purified on cesium chloride gradients. The number of transducing units (TU) was determined by infecting K91Kan-resistant cells with an aliquot from each library and plating on tet plates. FUSE5-vector DNA containing an insert restores the reading frame of the pIII gene product, enabling the phage to infect K91Kan-resistant cells and produce colonies on tet plates."

A library of 4.0e7 independent clones encoding 20-mer peptide sequences embedded between the BspEI and Acc65I cloning sites of fAFF-BA was constructed. This 20-mer library, referred to as IR20, differs from the original library in that the cloning region within the bacteriophage vector has been modified. This allows for efficient directional cloning and results in the addition of Ser-Gly to the N-terminus of the peptide-pIII fusion. In the previously used library, the 20-mer library is located directly at the N-terminus of the fusion, and it is possible that modification of the N-terminal amino group of the peptides may disrupt cell targeting."

MANP comprises 8164 bases. The bla gene was from pGEM3Zf1(+), was bound by BamHI-HindIII sites at the 5' end and HindIII-SalI sites at the 3' end, replaced bases 6001 through 6432 of M13mp18, and was in the same orientation as the phage genes. The junction between the III signal sequence and mature III was modified with an NcoI restriction site embedded in the last three codons of the signal sequence. After the III signal, MANP contained the sequence of BPTI with restriction sites for the enzymes StyI, XhoI, PflMI, ApaI, Bsp120I, EcoO109I, PspOMI, BssHII, StuI, BstZ17I, BlpI, EagI, and SphI, which were all unique within MANP. Following BPTI, a unique PstI site and a Factor Xa cleavage site were inserted in a short linker region before mature III. The DNA encoding the library was synthesized with constant DNA on either side so that the DNA could be PCR amplified using TAQ DNA polymerase, cleaved with NcoI and PstI, and ligated to similarly cleaved vector. The variegated parts were synthesized with TRIM technology, which incorporates trinucleotides and allows mixtures of any set of amino acid types in any desired proportions.

Belcher #LibrarySeqLength 8 #LibraryComplexity unknown #LibraryTiter unknown #LibraryRandomness Completely random #LibraryCodingScheme NNM #LibraryTopology Linear #LibraryComments The M13KE phage vector was modified by making a cloning site for pVIII display. A Pst I restriction site was made by mutating T to A at position 1372, a BamH I site was made by mutating C to G at positon 1381, and the Pst I site at position 6246 was deleted by mutating T to A at position 6250. The site-directed mutagenesis was done using overlap extension PCR. A dsDNA library was then prepared and cloned into the resulting modified phage vector, named M13SK, using Pst I and BamH I. To obtain the dsDNA library, partial library duplexes were formed by annealing of extension primer (5\'-GATGCTGTCTTTCGCTGCAG-3\') with oligonucleotides (3\'-ACGACAGAAAGCGACGTCnm(nnm)6nnCCTAGGAACATC ATC-5\', where n=A, T, C, or G and m=A or C). The partial library duplexes were incubated with Klenow fragment (3\'→'5\' exo-) (10 U/μL) and dNTP at 37 °C for 30 min. The Klenow fragment was inactivated by heating (75 °C for 20 min), and the mixture was digested with Pst I and BamH I. The digested DNA was gel purified (2-40% TBE polyacrylamide gel), ligated into M13SK, and transfected to XL1-Blue Electroporation Competent Cells using a MicroPulser (Biorad). The library was titered according to manufacturer directions and sequenced (MIT Biopolymers Laboratory) before amplification."

Alternatively, extended PCR primers can be used to accomplish the same as has been described previously. Libraries were constructed as described below. Briefly, two 5’ biotinylated oligonucleotides were used. The first contained the redundant ""library"" sequence, e.g., 7×NNK flanked by BglI sites compatible with the two SfiI sites of the vector (61 bases). The second oligonucleotide, 18 bases, complemented the 3’ end of the first and was extended to ""fill-in"" the complementary strand using Klenow polymerase. The product was digested with BglI, the short biotinylated segments were removed with Streptavidin conjugated magnetic beads and the eluent was cloned into SfiI digested fth1-dp vector.

Smith (University of Missouri, Columbia, MO) #LibrarySeqLength 15 #LibraryComplexity 5.90E+08 #LibraryTiter unknown #LibraryRandomness Semi-random #LibraryCodingScheme NNK #LibraryTopology Circular #LibraryComments The f88–Cys5 phage display library (GenBank Accession AF246454) is based on vector f88-4 (Accession AF218363). The filamentous phage-display library displaying random peptides on the virion surface, fused to a recombinant version of the major coat protein pVIII. Each peptide has two cysteines at fixed positions 5 residues apart within the otherwise randomized amino acids, and thus is potentially constrained conformationally by a disulfide bond. The random amino acids are specified by degenerate codons in a synthetic oligonucleotide insert, which was spliced into vector f88-4 between its HindIII and PstI cloning sites in recombinant gene rVIII. The resulting recombinant, insert-bearing rVIII-Cys5 gene, encoding recombinant protein rpVIII-Cys5, is inducible by IPTG. The phage genome also contains the wild-type gene VIII, which is expressed constitutively. Most of the 4000 major coat-protein subunits in the virion derive from the wild-type VIII gene, but under fully induced conditions (1 mM IPTG) up to 300 subunits are rpVIII-Cys5 polypeptides derive from the recombinant, insert-bearing rVIII-Cys5 gene. The library comprises 5.9e8 primary phage clones altogether, each represented by many phage particles as a result of replication of the library en masse in Escherichia coli host cells."

Gly24 was not mutated. Each of their codons was replaced with the NVS codon (N = A + T + G + C,V = A + G + C, S = G + C). Genes were then amplified by using two different primers so that the EcoRI and HindIII recognition sites could be added at the 5' and 3' termini, respectively. Amplified DNA fragments were digested with EcoRI and HindIII and then ligated to T7 Select Vector Arms (Merck Millipore, Germany). For in vitro packaging, ligated DNA fragments were added to T7 phage packaging extracts (Merck Millipore) and the mixtures were incubated at 25 °C for 2 h. After phage packaging, a T7 phage library containing 7.4e6 independent clones was constructed."
