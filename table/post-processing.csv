ABPO,"Before proceeding to the next round of biopanning, non-specific phages that were included in the selected phages were removed by a âsubtractionâ (or negative selection) step by using epoxy-functionalized magnetic particles without a myeloperoxidase from human leukocytes (hMPO) coating (ânudeâ magnetic particles). The supernatant from this subtraction step was introduced to the next round."

ABPQ,The positive selection was carried out with protein G magnetic micro beads (Miltenyi Biotec) labelled with human IgG anti-hepatitis E virus (HEV) positive serum. The eluted bound phage was negatively selected with beads labelled with human IgG anti-HEV negative serum. Unbound phage from negative selection was amplified in E. coli ER2738 by a high-throughput method [38] and subjected to one more round of biopanning with different positive and negative sera.

ABPT,"Initially, phages were incubated for 1 hour with HNO97 grown to 90% conï¬uence. Unbound phages were removed by washing steps and the cells were lysed with 1% Triton X-100 solution. Phages isolated from cell lysate were amplified and packaged in XL1 blue bacteria overnight and precipitated in polyethylenglycole solution . Subsequently, the phages were exposed alternatingly to HNO97 cells and HNO97 protein fractions (100nmol/L) in96-well plates for1 hour. After 5 PBS washing steps phages were eluted in 100 mLGlycin/HCl (pH 2.2) per well, neutralized by 15 mL Tris-HCl(pH 9.1) and amplified in XL1 blue bacteria. For titration, the phages were diluted and grown on agar plates. Twelve selection rounds were performed followed by single stranded DNA isolation of 16 clones (QIApreo Spin M13 Kit;Qiagen)."
ABPU,Three panning rounds were performed directly on the fusion GST-p53 that was previously fixed on G-Sepharose beads.
ABPV,"The M13 phage display library displaying 12-mer random peptides (Ph.D-12 Phage Display Peptide Library Kit, New England Biolabs) was used. Affinity selection of the phage clones from the random peptide library was conducted following the manufacturer's recommendations with minor modifications. "
ABPW,"Considering the possible non-specific binding that emerges in the interaction between the phage library and L-Fn14 CRD, competitive elution was conducted to avoid the elution of background-bound phage. The natural ligand of Fn14, TWEAK, was served as the eluent."
ABPX,"50ul aliquots of each 18-mer phage library containing approximately 50 copies of each distinct 18-mer phage peptide were applied to the external surface of intact TMs of six rats. The phage samples were then pooled, amplified in E. coli, and the resulting library applied to the TMs of additional rats for two more rounds of library enrichment. After the third round, 30 individual phage plaques were selected at random and sequenced to identify the expressed peptide. After a 15-minute incubation on the TM, the external ear canal was repeatedly rinsed with PBS to remove all bacteriophage. The rats were then sacrificed and the ME bullas harvested intact. The exterior surface of the bulla was then extensively rinsed to remove contaminating phage. The bulla was then opened, exposing the ME contents. Fluid was collected from the ME, diluted in PBS and bacteriophage were titered using E. coli ER2738 (New England Biolabs, Cambridge, MA). The phage samples were then pooled, amplified in E. coli, and the resulting library applied to the TMs of additional rats for two more rounds of library enrichment."
ABPY,"At the 3rd and 4th rounds, phages were subtracted using cytidine triphosphate synthase 1 (CTPS2) immobilized magnetic beads."
ABPZ,"50 Î¼l aliquots of the naÃ¯ve phage library, each containing 1,000 copies of the 2.9Ã 109 different peptide sequences in the library, were placed on the outer surface of the TM (Tympanic membrane) of anesthetized and immobilized rats with active OM (Otitis media), then laid on their side for 1 hr. Te remaining phage solution was removed by wicking and the TMs were then extensively washed with PBS several times to remove any unbound phage particles from the external canal and reduce the possibility of ME (Middle ear) sample contamination. The animals were then sacrificed by decapitation under deep anesthesia to isolate the ME from the single side where phage was applied. The bullas of the rats were then dissected, isolated, and further rinsed in PBS prior to opening, as another precaution against contamination. The bulla then was opened and ME effusion was collected in a sterile tube for further analysis. The number of phage particles present in the ME fluid sample was assessed using an aliquot of supernatant in standard plaque assay. Phage in the remaining fluid were amplified by infecting bacteria via standard methods29 to generate a library of candidate TM-translocating phage, which was re-applied onto the TMs again using the protocol described above. The screen was successively repeated twice before DNA sequencing."
ABQA,"In the first stage, the commercial phage library was applied onto the TM (Tympanic membrane) of ears with OM, allowed to incubate for 1 hour (hr), and the external canal was extensively rinsed with PBS to remove unbound phage as described earlier. The TM was then harvested from the ME (Middle ear) bulla, washed with PBS, and homogenized. Phage present in the homogenate was amplified, and the process was repeated twice to generate a library enriched for phage with TM-binding activity. We then exposed TMs of infected rats to this preselected library, followed by elution with low pH buffer to remove all phage that had not internalized into the membrane. The TM was again harvested by dissection, homogenized, and phage libraries were amplified in 3 consecutive rounds. The resulting âinternalizing phageâ selected library was again applied to the TM surface of ears for 1 hr in rats with OM (Otitis media). Fluids were then recovered from the opposite ME cavity side, phage within the samples were amplified, and re-applied for three additional rounds. 30 phage particles from the final two rounds of in vivo selection were chosen at random and sequenced to identify the peptides displayed by the transported phage. Using this successive selection procedure (ten rounds total), additional populations of peptide-targeted phage with the ability to bind, internalize and finally transit the TM were identified. Two animals per condition were used. Pooled samples recovered from the final round of in vivo selection were sequenced."

After incubation, the cells were washed with PBS and then 100Âµl of 0.2M Glycine-HCl, pH. 2.2 were added to elute cell-bound phage. After 10 mins, 15Âµl of 1M Tris-HCl, pH 9.1 was added to neutralize the solution and the eluted phage were recovered. The cells were washed again with PBS and then 100Âµl 30mM Tris, pH. 8.0 was added. The cells were frozenthawed until they had ruptured as judged by light microscopy (three cycles). The ruptured cell mixture was collected and centrifuged at 2000rpm for 2 min; the supernatant containing the PC3 internalized phage was recovered. Phage were titrated, amplified and the exposure procedure was repeated twice more."

ABQR,"The UN1 mAb (10 Î¼g) was linked to streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads (Promega), which had been coated with 10 Î¼g of goat anti-mouse IgG (Fc-speciï¬c) biotin-conjugated Ab (Sigma-Aldrich) in 200 Î¼L of beads suspension. A total of 3.0e10 transducing units of phages from the library were added and incubated for 16 hours at 4 Â°C. After extensive washing, bound phages were eluted with 0.1 mol/L HCl/glycine buffer, pH 2.2, 1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA), and neutralized with 1 mol/L Tris, pH9.1. Eluted phages were ampliï¬ed by infection of K91BK bacteria, and puriï¬ed from plaques for a second round of afï¬nity selection. Phage colonies were transferred according to an ordered grid on a lawn of K91BK cells on Luria-Bertani (LB) agar plates supplemented with 1 mmol/L isopropyl b-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside. Nitrocellulose ï¬lters were layered onto these plates and incubated overnight at 37 Â°C.

Collected phage supernatants from positive clones were further analyzed by ELISA."
ABQS,"A method termed biopanning and rapid analysis of selective interactive ligands (BRASIL) was used. BRASIL allows separation of phage-cell complexes from the remaining unbound phage; this is accomplished by a differential centrifugation that drives the cells from a hydrophilic environment into a non-miscible organic phase. Because the organic phase is hydrophobic, it excludes water-soluble materials surrounding cell surfaces. Bound phage are recovered from the cell pellet whereas the unbound phage remain soluble in the upper aqueous phase, eliminating the need for repeated washes. A two-step panning strategy to isolate phage that bind to angiogenic ECs was used. First, to decrease non-specific binding, we pre-cleared the phage library on starved ECs (before panning on the same cell line stimulated with recombinant VEGF165); starved human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs) were incubated with the phage library and centrifuged through the organic phase. Second, the unbound phage pool left in the aqueous phase was transferred to a fresh tube and incubated with VEGF165-stimulated HUVECs. After centrifugation through the organic phase, phage bound to the VEGF165-stimulated HUVEC pellet were recovered by bacterial infection, amplified and subjected to two more rounds of selection."

ABQW,"For the first two rounds, DXS functionalized with N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)âdesthiobiotin and Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin C1 (Invitrogen 65001) were used to capture DXS from the solution. For the third round, to avoid selection of phages against streptavidin and given that D. radiodurans DXS contains an N-terminal Histag, MagneHis Ni Particles (Promega V8560) were used as capturing system. After the incubation step, 0.1 mL of beads were added to the solution, which was mixed in a thermo shaker at 48Cfor15 min. The tube was placed in a magnetic rack to allow for adhesion of the magnetic beads on one side of the tube. Phages expressing DXS binders were retained on the bead surface, and the buffer containing unbound phages was gently discarded from the tube. To remove weakly bound phages further, the beads were washed with PBST (10V1 mLPBS with 0.05% Tween 20) whilst retaining them using a magnetic rack. The elution of strongly bound phages from the beads was achieved by suspending the beads in the elution buffer (1 mL, 1mM Biotin in PBS for rounds 1 and 2 and 500 mm imidazole in PBS for round 3)."
ABQX,"Two rounds of selection were performed by using a custom-made phage library. TBS (trisbuffered saline, 50 mm TrisÂ·HCl pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) was used as incubation buffer,TBST (TBS with 0.05% Tween 20) was used as washing buffer, MagneHis Ni Particles (Promega V8560) were employed for protein recovery, and 1mm ThDP in TBS was used as elution buffer.

After washing of the beads with PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 (PBST), they were incubated with 1.0e12 pfu of phage libraries (mixture of X12, X16, and X20) for 1h at room temperature, and then washed with PBST (three times for the first round, five times for the second round, and 10 times for the third to sixth rounds). Bound phages were eluted with 200 Î¼L of 0.5% SDS and then transfected into 80 mL of E. coli BLT5615 cells (Merck Millipore) in the log phase of growth for amplification. After bacteriolysis, the phages were recovered from the culture supernatant by centrifugation and PEG precipitation, according to the T7 Select manual.

ABRE,"Brain endothelial cells derived from four deeply anesthetized rats with acute EAE (score 3) and four healthy rats were isolated. Briefly, brain pieces were gently homogenized, mixed with 30% dextran. The vascular fraction was filtered and digested in DMEM. Endothelial cells were pelleted and incubated with the phages for 2 h at 20 Â°C. The counter-selection step was performed by incubating 5e5 healthy brain capillary endothelial cells (BCECs) with 1e11 phages in 1 mL RPMI. After centrifugation of cells, the unbound phages were transferred on 4e5 EAE-BCEC for 2 h to obtain phages of the EAE-BCEC selection.

The whole CNS tissues from both rats were recovered separately (about 2.3 g), cut into small pieces, and incubated for 50 min at 37 Â°C in 10 mL of PBS 1Ã. The recovered cells were concentrated and frozen. The Bex vivo total EAE selection^ was performed in two steps: (i) a counter-selection with CNS cells from a healthy rat realized to absorb healthy tissuespecific phages and (ii) the selection against cells from the EAE CNS. Thus, 1011 phages were incubated with 4.0 Ã 106 CNS cells from a healthy rat before incubation of the unbound phages with CNS cells from a EAE rat (4.0 Ã 106). After incubation, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation (1200 rpm/5 min/RT) and washed with 1 mL complemented RMPI. The phages that remained associated with cells were amplified.

ABRZ,"Phages (1e12 plaque-forming units) were incubated with CD63 LEL purified protein for 2 hours, and unbound phages were removed by washing with PBS solution for three times. The bound phages were recovered with glycine-HCl buffer (pH 2.2), followed by neutralization with tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.8). Recovered phages were titered and amplified for subsequent cycles. This process was repeated twice, and the recovered phage clonesâ sequences were identified by high-throughput sequencing (Genewiz)."
ABSA,"A Ph.D.-12 phage library displaying random dodecapeptides was used to isolate FRÎ±binding phages with four rounds of biopanning.

Afer each round of biopanning, the bound phages were eluted and elutes were tested by phage ELISA to evaluate the afnity to FRÎ±."
ABSB,"Te aim of this study was to evaluate phage display technology for mapping Haemonchus contortus mimotopes. We screened the PhD 7 Phage Display Peptide Library Kit with a sheep polyclonal antibody against H. contortus. After four rounds of selection, 50 phage peptide clones were selected by biopanning and sequenced."
ABSC,"The M. pneumoniae-positive serum was used as the target for biopanning to phage display random 7-peptide library. The representative phages were identifed using dot immunoblotting and ELISA. The exogenous heptapeptides were synthesized and their reactions with M. pneumonia-positive serum were tested by indirect ELISA. Two heptapeptides, namely heptapeptide 1: TVNFKLY and heptapeptide 2: LPQRLRT, were screened out from the randomly selected 40 phages after the four biopanning rounds."
ABSD,"First, MDA-MB-231 cells were prepared as a 1e6 cell suspension in 500 Î¼l of DMEM containing 5% bull serum albumin and were incubated with 1e11 pfu of ph. D.-CX7C phage library on ice for 2 h. Thereafter, unbound phages were washed away. Specific-binding phages were transferred into the organic lower phase and were amplified with coliER2738 host cells. After three rounds, the phages were titrated on plates and were picked up for DNA extraction."
ABSE,"At least 1e12 transducing units of the f3-15mer phage library were intravenously injected into each tumor-bearing mouse through the tail vein and allowed to circulate for 1h before euthanasia by CO2 asphyxiation. Subsequently, 20ml of phosphate-buffered saline buffer was used to wash the unassociated phages by heart perfusion. The tumor-recognized phages were puriï¬ed from the tumor homogenate and ampliï¬ed for use as new input phages for the next round of selection. The tumor-homing peptide sequences in every round of selection were identified by phage genome sequencing from the third to fifth round."
ABSF,"The culture medium was removed when the HFE-145 cells reached ~70% confluency. 1x1011 pfu phages was added and mixed gently with the blocked HFE-145 cells for 1 h at 37â¹C. During this time, the MKN-45 cells were pre-washed and blocked in the same manner. Then, the supernatant containing unbound phages was transferred to blocked MKN45 containing wells and incubated for 2 h on a rocker platform at 37â. The rest of the phage was amplified using E. coli ER2738 host cells for next rounds of biopanning. For each round of panning, 1x1011 pfu of collected phages was used and the detergent (Tween 20) and salt (NaCl) concentrations were increased in a stepwise manner to 0.5%."
ABSG,"Each phage clone expresses a unique sequence of 9 random amino acids (nonamer) on their surface, followed by a His6-tag in the C-terminus of capsid protein 10. The phages are subsequently immobilized on Ni-NTA agarose beads via interactions with the His6-tag. The purified hCG was used to screen the phage library for peptides susceptible to cleavage. After the first selection step, the released phages, which are cleaved in their unique random region, were amplified in E. coli and subjected to additional biopannings. Selections of phages susceptible to cleavage by the protease, were performed over 5 biopannings."
ABSH,"The Kelchlike ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) was used as a target for screening the bicyclic peptide ligands in the library. About 1e13 purified infective phage particles were incubated with the biotinylated target protein captured on magnetic streptavidin or neutravidin beads, and the enriched phages were subjected to two further rounds of selection. To prevent the enrichment of streptavidin and neutravidin binders during panning, the biotinylated protein was captured alternately in each round of selection with streptavidin and neutravidin."
