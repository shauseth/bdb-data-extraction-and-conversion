After a 15-minute incubation on the TM, the external ear canal was repeatedly rinsed with PBS to remove all bacteriophage. The rats were then sacrificed and the ME bullas harvested intact. The exterior surface of the bulla was then extensively rinsed to remove contaminating phage. The bulla was then opened, exposing the ME contents. Fluid was collected from the ME, diluted in PBS and bacteriophage were titered using E. coli ER2738 (New England Biolabs, Cambridge, MA). The phage samples were then pooled, amplified in E. coli, and the resulting library applied to the TMs of additional rats for two more rounds of library enrichment."
ABPY,"At the 3rd and 4th rounds, phages were subtracted using cytidine triphosphate synthase 1 (CTPS2) immobilized magnetic beads."
ABPZ,"50 μl aliquots of the naïve phage library, each containing 1,000 copies of the 2.9× 109 different peptide sequences in the library, were placed on the outer surface of the TM (Tympanic membrane) of anesthetized and immobilized rats with active OM (Otitis media), then laid on their side for 1 hr. Te remaining phage solution was removed by wicking and the TMs were then extensively washed with PBS several times to remove any unbound phage particles from the external canal and reduce the possibility of ME (Middle ear) sample contamination. The animals were then sacrificed by decapitation under deep anesthesia to isolate the ME from the single side where phage was applied. The bullas of the rats were then dissected, isolated, and further rinsed in PBS prior to opening, as another precaution against contamination. The bulla then was opened and ME effusion was collected in a sterile tube for further analysis. The number of phage particles present in the ME fluid sample was assessed using an aliquot of supernatant in standard plaque assay. Phage in the remaining fluid were amplified by infecting bacteria via standard methods29 to generate a library of candidate TM-translocating phage, which was re-applied onto the TMs again using the protocol described above. The screen was successively repeated twice before DNA sequencing."
ABQA,"In the first stage, the commercial phage library was applied onto the TM (Tympanic membrane) of ears with OM, allowed to incubate for 1 hour (hr), and the external canal was extensively rinsed with PBS to remove unbound phage as described earlier. The TM was then harvested from the ME (Middle ear) bulla, washed with PBS, and homogenized. Phage present in the homogenate was amplified, and the process was repeated twice to generate a library enriched for phage with TM-binding activity. We then exposed TMs of infected rats to this preselected library, followed by elution with low pH buffer to remove all phage that had not internalized into the membrane. The TM was again harvested by dissection, homogenized, and phage libraries were amplified in 3 consecutive rounds. The resulting “internalizing phage” selected library was again applied to the TM surface of ears for 1 hr in rats with OM (Otitis media). Fluids were then recovered from the opposite ME cavity side, phage within the samples were amplified, and re-applied for three additional rounds. 30 phage particles from the final two rounds of in vivo selection were chosen at random and sequenced to identify the peptides displayed by the transported phage. Using this successive selection procedure (ten rounds total), additional populations of peptide-targeted phage with the ability to bind, internalize and finally transit the TM were identified. Two animals per condition were used. Pooled samples recovered from the final round of in vivo selection were sequenced."

ABQR,"The UN1 mAb (10 μg) was linked to streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads (Promega), which had been coated with 10 μg of goat anti-mouse IgG (Fc-speciﬁc) biotin-conjugated Ab (Sigma-Aldrich) in 200 μL of beads suspension. A total of 3.0e10 transducing units of phages from the library were added and incubated for 16 hours at 4 °C. After extensive washing, bound phages were eluted with 0.1 mol/L HCl/glycine buffer, pH 2.2, 1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA), and neutralized with 1 mol/L Tris, pH9.1. Eluted phages were ampliﬁed by infection of K91BK bacteria, and puriﬁed from plaques for a second round of afﬁnity selection. Phage colonies were transferred according to an ordered grid on a lawn of K91BK cells on Luria-Bertani (LB) agar plates supplemented with 1 mmol/L isopropyl b-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside. Nitrocellulose ﬁlters were layered onto these plates and incubated overnight at 37 °C.

After extensive washing, filters were incubated in developing solution (1-Step NBT/BCIP, Pierce, Thermo Scientiﬁc). Collected phage supernatants from positive clones were further analyzed by ELISA."
ABQS,"A method termed biopanning and rapid analysis of selective interactive ligands (BRASIL) was used. BRASIL allows separation of phage-cell complexes from the remaining unbound phage; this is accomplished by a differential centrifugation that drives the cells from a hydrophilic environment into a non-miscible organic phase. Because the organic phase is hydrophobic, it excludes water-soluble materials surrounding cell surfaces. Bound phage are recovered from the cell pellet whereas the unbound phage remain soluble in the upper aqueous phase, eliminating the need for repeated washes. A two-step panning strategy to isolate phage that bind to angiogenic ECs was used. First, to decrease non-specific binding, we pre-cleared the phage library on starved ECs (before panning on the same cell line stimulated with recombinant VEGF165); starved human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs) were incubated with the phage library and centrifuged through the organic phase. Second, the unbound phage pool left in the aqueous phase was transferred to a fresh tube and incubated with VEGF165-stimulated HUVECs. After centrifugation through the organic phase, phage bound to the VEGF165-stimulated HUVEC pellet were recovered by bacterial infection, amplified and subjected to two more rounds of selection."

ABQW,"For the first two rounds, DXS functionalized with N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)–desthiobiotin and Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin C1 (Invitrogen 65001) were used to capture DXS from the solution. For the third round, to avoid selection of phages against streptavidin and given that D. radiodurans DXS contains an N-terminal Histag, MagneHis Ni Particles (Promega V8560) were used as capturing system. After the incubation step, 0.1 mL of beads were added to the solution, which was mixed in a thermo shaker at 48Cfor15 min. The tube was placed in a magnetic rack to allow for adhesion of the magnetic beads on one side of the tube. Phages expressing DXS binders were retained on the bead surface, and the buffer containing unbound phages was gently discarded from the tube. To remove weakly bound phages further, the beads were washed with PBST (10V1 mLPBS with 0.05% Tween 20) whilst retaining them using a magnetic rack. The elution of strongly bound phages from the beads was achieved by suspending the beads in the elution buffer (1 mL, 1mM Biotin in PBS for rounds 1 and 2 and 500 mm imidazole in PBS for round 3)."
ABQX,"Two rounds of selection were performed by using a custom-made phage library. TBS (trisbuffered saline, 50 mm Tris·HCl pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) was used as incubation buffer,TBST (TBS with 0.05% Tween 20) was used as washing buffer, MagneHis Ni Particles (Promega V8560) were employed for protein recovery, and 1mm ThDP in TBS was used as elution buffer. ThDP was chosen as competitive eluent to elute peptides specifically interacting with the ThDP-binding site of DXS."

After washing of the beads with PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 (PBST), they were incubated with 1.0e12 pfu of phage libraries (mixture of X12, X16, and X20) for 1h at room temperature, and then washed with PBST (three times for the first round, five times for the second round, and 10 times for the third to sixth rounds). Bound phages were eluted with 200 μL of 0.5% SDS and then transfected into 80 mL of E. coli BLT5615 cells (Merck Millipore) in the log phase of growth for amplification. After bacteriolysis, the phages were recovered from the culture supernatant by centrifugation and PEG precipitation, according to the T7 Select manual. The recovered phages were dissolved in 1mL of PBS and 0.5 mL of the phages was used for the next round of biopanning."

ABRE,"Brain endothelial cells derived from four deeply anesthetized rats with acute EAE (score 3) and four healthy rats were isolated. Briefly, brain pieces were gently homogenized, mixed with 30% dextran. The vascular fraction was filtered and digested in DMEM. Endothelial cells were pelleted and incubated with the phages for 2 h at 20 °C. The counter-selection step was performed by incubating 5e5 healthy brain capillary endothelial cells (BCECs) with 1e11 phages in 1 mL RPMI. After centrifugation of cells, the unbound phages were transferred on 4e5 EAE-BCEC for 2 h to obtain phages of the EAE-BCEC selection. The phages that remained bound to cells were recovered, amplified in E. coli ER 2738 bacteria. Four selection rounds were performed with isolated healthy or EAEBCEC."
ABRF,"CNS cells were prepared from rat CNS. A rat with acute EAE (score 3) was deeply anesthetized and perfused with 50 mL ice-cold PBS 1×. The whole CNS tissues from both rats were recovered separately (about 2.3 g), cut into small pieces, and incubated for 50 min at 37 °C in 10 mL of PBS 1×. The recovered cells were concentrated and frozen. The Bex vivo total EAE selection^ was performed in two steps: (i) a counter-selection with CNS cells from a healthy rat realized to absorb healthy tissuespecific phages and (ii) the selection against cells from the EAE CNS. Thus, 1011 phages were incubated with 4.0 × 106 CNS cells from a healthy rat before incubation of the unbound phages with CNS cells from a EAE rat (4.0 × 106). After incubation, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation (1200 rpm/5 min/RT) and washed with 1 mL complemented RMPI. The phages that remained associated with cells were amplified. At each selection round, one additional washing step of cells associated with phages was added to increase the selection stringency, so that five washes were performed during the fifth round."

ABSD,"First, MDA-MB-231 cells were prepared as a 1e6 cell suspension in 500 μl of DMEM containing 5% bull serum albumin and were incubated with 1e11 pfu of ph. D.-CX7C phage library on ice for 2 h. Thereafter, unbound phages were washed away. Specific-binding phages were transferred into the organic lower phase and were amplified with coliER2738 host cells. After three rounds, the phages were titrated on plates and were picked up for DNA extraction."
ABSE,"At least 1e12 transducing units of the f3-15mer phage library were intravenously injected into each tumor-bearing mouse through the tail vein and allowed to circulate for 1h before euthanasia by CO2 asphyxiation. Subsequently, 20ml of phosphate-buffered saline buffer was used to wash the unassociated phages by heart perfusion. The tumor-recognized phages were puriﬁed from the tumor homogenate and ampliﬁed for use as new input phages for the next round of selection. The tumor-homing peptide sequences in every round of selection were identified by phage genome sequencing from the third to fifth round."
ABSF,"The culture medium was removed when the HFE-145 cells reached ~70% confluency. 1x1011 pfu phages was added and mixed gently with the blocked HFE-145 cells for 1 h at 37ⅹC. During this time, the MKN-45 cells were pre-washed and blocked in the same manner. Then, the supernatant containing unbound phages was transferred to blocked MKN45 containing wells and incubated for 2 h on a rocker platform at 37℃. The rest of the phage was amplified using E. coli ER2738 host cells for next rounds of biopanning. For each round of panning, 1x1011 pfu of collected phages was used and the detergent (Tween 20) and salt (NaCl) concentrations were increased in a stepwise manner to 0.5%."
ABSG,"Each phage clone expresses a unique sequence of 9 random amino acids (nonamer) on their surface, followed by a His6-tag in the C-terminus of capsid protein 10. The phages are subsequently immobilized on Ni-NTA agarose beads via interactions with the His6-tag. The purified hCG was used to screen the phage library for peptides susceptible to cleavage. After the first selection step, the released phages, which are cleaved in their unique random region, were amplified in E. coli and subjected to additional biopannings. Selections of phages susceptible to cleavage by the protease, were performed over 5 biopannings."
ABSH,"The Kelchlike ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) was used as a target for screening the bicyclic peptide ligands in the library. About 1e13 purified infective phage particles were incubated with the biotinylated target protein captured on magnetic streptavidin or neutravidin beads, and the enriched phages were subjected to two further rounds of selection. To prevent the enrichment of streptavidin and neutravidin binders during panning, the biotinylated protein was captured alternately in each round of selection with streptavidin and neutravidin."
ABSI,"Ph.D.-7 phage display library was sequentially exposed to a series of normal, control cells in the following order: HUVEC, 3T3, murine heart cell suspension, murine kidney cell suspension, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, human erythrocytes to remove non-relevant phage clones.   After the final absorption, the resultant negatively selected phage pool was termed “adsorbed phage library"". A20 cells (1e6) were incubated with the adsorbed phage library for 1 h at 37 °C with gentle shaking. After titration of this lysate, 10–15 isolated plaques were individually recovered, amplified and their DNA extracted according the library manufacturer’s instructions. Peptide inserts were sequenced by Sanger sequencing (Hylabs, Israel) using primers supplied by New England Biolabs and peptide amino acid sequences were deduced."
ABSJ,"To identify epitopes recognized by the eluted anti-GBM autoantibody, a combinatorial library peptide (12-mers) phage display kit was utilized (Ph.D.™ 12mer Phage Display Library, New England Biolabs, MA) following manufacturer’s protocol for solution phase panning with affinity bead capture. The bound phages were collected by magnetic field and eluted by incubation for 10 minutes with 1ml of glycine elution buffer (0.2M Glycine-HCl, pH2.2, 1mg/ml BSA)."
ABSK,"To eliminate peptides that bind to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, 1e9 phage in PBS containing calcium and magnesium (PBS++), and supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA), were incubated three rounds with wild-type CHO cells plated on 10 cm tissue culture plates, each for 1 h at room temperature on a rocker. Unbound phage were then incubated with CHO cells expressing human CD177."
ABSL,The library was firstly incubated three rounds with CHO cells expressing HA-FPR to eliminate peptides that bound to the HA-tag. Unbound phage were then incubated with CHO cells expressing mouse CD177.
ABSM,"In brief, a CX6C (C, cysteine; X, any residue) phage-displayed peptide library was precleared on a pool (50 samples) of protein G-purified antibodies from age-matched healthy donor men to remove nonspecific peptides. Next, the precleared library was incubated with purified serum IgG from a prostate cancer patient of year 1. Three rounds of selection were performed."
ABSN,"In brief, a CX6C (C, cysteine; X, any residue) phage-displayed peptide library was precleared on a pool (50 samples) of protein G-purified antibodies from age-matched healthy donor men to remove nonspecific peptides. Next, the precleared library was incubated with purified serum IgG from a prostate cancer patient of year 5. Three rounds of selection were performed."
ABSO,"In brief, a CX6C (C, cysteine; X, any residue) phage-displayed peptide library was precleared on a pool (50 samples) of protein G-purified antibodies from age-matched healthy donor men to remove nonspecific peptides. Next, the precleared library was incubated with purified serum IgG from a prostate cancer patient of year 7. Three rounds of selection were performed."
ABSP,"Prior to positive selection, phage were counter-selected for high-affinity muscle and fat tissue binding by pre-adsorbing the tissues with the library. For positive selection, phage libraries were mixed directly with human sural nerve tissue."
