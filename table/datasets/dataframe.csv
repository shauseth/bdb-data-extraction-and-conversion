BALB/c mice were immunized subcutaneously with 20 μg of a recombinant form of mammalian cell-expressed HCV strain Gla E1E2 emulsified in Freund\'s complete adjuvant. After 4 weeks, the animals were boosted with E1E2 emulsified in Freund\'s incomplete adjuvant. Mice were further boosted twice at 2-week intervals. Eight days following the last injection, the sera from tail bleeds were tested for E1E2-specific antibodies. Three weeks following the last boost, the animals were given a final intraperitoneal injection of 100 μg of purified recombinant E1E2. Spleen cells from immunized animals were removed 5 days postinjection and fused with Sp2/0-Ag 14 myeloma cells (ratio, 10:1) by using 50% polyethylene glycol 1500 in DMEM. Cells were then resuspended in HAT medium (EFC10 supplemented with histone acetyltransferase) and 20% conditioned medium (i.e., clarified EFC10 that had previously been used to grow Sp2/0 cells), plated out into 96-well microtiter plates, placed in a CO2 humidified incubator at 37°C, and left for 12 to 14 days. Medium from wells containing colonies was removed and screened by ELISA for E1E2-specific MAbs. Cells from positive wells were removed and propagated. The epitopes recognized by MAb AP33 epitope was mapped to LINTNGSWHIN (412-423) using overlapping peptides. This epitope is highly conserved across all the major genotypes and that MAb AP33 is capable of broad neutralization was demostrated with the retroviral pseudoparticles (HCVpp) assay."

The cells were dispensed into 144 tissue culture wells in 2-ml volumes of hypoxanthine-aminopterine-thymidine-selective  mediums,  using  RPMI-1640  medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum as a base. After 10 days, the culture supernatants were tested for P. yoelii-specific antibody by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF). Of 143 cultures tested, 38 were positive, 20 producing antibody apparently directed against the infected erythrocyte membrane and 18 producing antibody against the parasite itself. From the initial screening, five distinct IIF specificities were detected. Cultures representative of each of the IIF specificities were expanded in selective medium without aminopterine, and hybridoma lines were subsequently cloned in semi-solid agar overlayed with medium. Hybridoma 25.77 was one of them. Monoclonal antibody 25.77 belongs to the subclass IgG2a. It was found that 25.77 bound to antigens only present in merozoites, free and within mature schizonts. Later, it was known that this antibody was specific for the P. yoelii yoelii 235-kDa rhoptry protein family. Passive immunization with MAb 25.77 suppressed blood-stage parasitemia and restricted the parasites to reticulocytes."

Takenaka #LibrarySeqLength 15 #LibraryComplexity 5.7e8 #LibraryTiter 2.5e11 #LibraryRandomness Completely random #LibraryCodingScheme NNM #LibraryTopology Linear #LibraryComments The 15-mer phage display random peptide library was constructed using the fUSE-5 vector, kindly provided by G. Smith (University of Missouri). FUSE-5 replicative Form DNA was purified from K802 Escherichia coli and linearized by SfiI digestion, and the resulting vector DNA was ligated to synthetic DNA fragments containing complementary BglI termini. These duplex oligonucleotides contained (NNM)15 triplets in the coding strand, where N corresponds to equivalent amounts of A, T, G, and C and where M corresponds to equivalent amounts of G and T (minimizes occurrence of translational stop codons). The noncoding strand consisted of 18 or 45 residue stretches of the inosine nucleotide analog. Recombinant DNA was electroporated into MC1061 E. coli electrocompetent cells, spread on 94 plates (24 x 24 cm) with NZamine-yeast extract (NZY) agar plus 40 μg/ml tetracycline (tet) and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Phage were collected by polyethylene glycol precipitation and purified on cesium chloride gradients. The number of transducing units (TU) was determined by infecting K91Kan-resistant cells with an aliquot from each library and plating on tet plates. FUSE5-vector DNA containing an insert restores the reading frame of the pIII gene product, enabling the phage to infect K91Kan-resistant cells and produce colonies on tet plates.","#TargetName Heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein #TargetSynonyms Heat shock 70 kDa protein 8

The genome of the Ff bacteriophage consists of the 11 genes designated gI to gXI. Although the protein (pIII) encoded by gIII is chymotrypsin-, thermolysin-, and subtilisin-susceptible, it is trypsin-resistant. Thus, phage display peptide libraries can give insight into the substrate specificities of certain proteases.","#TargetName Tryptase #TargetSynonyms Mast cell protease 7, mMCP-7

CD_antigen=CD195 #TargetSource Homo sapiens (Human):9606 #TargetType Protein>Receptor #TargetSequence P51681 #TargetStructure 2L87, 2RLL, 2RRS, 4MBS #TargetComments CCR5 is a member of the beta chemokine receptors family of integral membrane proteins. In Humans, the CCR5 gene location is on the short (p) arm at position 21 on chromosome 3. Certain populations have inherited the Delta 32 mutation resulting in the genetic deletion of a portion of the CCR5 gene. Homozygous carriers of this mutation are resistant to M-tropic strains of HIV-1 infection. There are several theoretical structure models of CCR5 in the PDB database, i.e. 1ND8, 1NE0, 1OPN, 1OPT and 1OPW."

This interaction induces a structural rearrangement creating a high affinity binding site for a chemokine coreceptor like CXCR4 and/or CCR5. This peculiar 2 stage receptor-interaction strategy allows gp120 to maintain the highly conserved coreceptor-binding site in a cryptic conformation, protected from neutralizing antibodies. Surface protein gp120 (SU) may target the virus to gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) by binding host ITGA4/ITGB7 (alpha-4/beta-7 integrins), a complex that mediates T-cell migration to the GALT. The surface protein gp120 is also a ligand for CD209/DC-SIGN and CLEC4M/DC-SIGNR, which are respectively found on dendritic cells (DCs), and on endothelial cells of liver sinusoids and lymph node sinuses. These interactions allow capture of viral particles at mucosal surfaces by these cells and subsequent transmission to permissive cells."

The Empirical formula of Biotin is C10H16O3N2S, with an unusual structure composed of a ureido (tetrahydroimidizalone) ring fused with a tetrahydrothiophene ring. Biotin is necessary for cell growth, the production of fatty acids, and the metabolism of fats and amino acids. It plays a role in the citric acid cycle, which is the process by which biochemical energy is generated during aerobic respiration. Biotin not only assists in various metabolic reactions but also helps to transfer carbon dioxide. Biotin may also be helpful in maintaining a steady blood sugar level. "

The construction of the hybridoma producing E16 monocloanl antibody is described briefly in the following sentences. BALB/c mice were primed and boosted at 3-week intervals with insect cell-generated, purified, recombinant WNV E protein (25 μg) that was complexed with adjuvant. Approximately 1 month after the last boost, serum was harvested and tested for immunoreactivity against solid-phase purified E protein. Mice with high titers (>1/10,000) were boosted intravenously with purified E protein (5 μg) in PBS. Three days later, splenocytes were harvested and fused to P3X63Ag8.653 myeloma cells to generate hybridomas."

Briefiy, 0.1 and 1.5 ml DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS were added to the apical and basolateral sides of the transwell, respectively, and the transwells then were preincubated for 30 min in a CO2 incubator. The Caco-2 cells then were spread to the apical side of the transwell. After incubation for 3 h, the medium at the apical side was changed, and the upper medium was changed every other day for the next 14 d of culture. Raji cells suspended in RPMI 1640/DMEM (1:2) mixture then were added to the basolateral chamber of the transwell, and the coculture was maintained for 2 d. Caco-2 cells cultured alone by this procedure, without the Raji cells, served as a control."

Brown #LibrarySeqLength 20 #LibraryComplexity 4.0e7 #LibraryTiter unknown #LibraryRandomness Completely random #LibraryCodingScheme NNS #LibraryTopology Linear #LibraryComments A new library of random 20-mer peptides in a phage vector was created by cloning the sequence into bacteriophage vector fAFF-1. A library of 4.0e7 independent clones encoding 20-mer peptide sequences embedded between the BspEI and Acc65I cloning sites of fAFF-BA was constructed. This 20-mer library, referred to as IR20, differs from the original library in that the cloning region within the bacteriophage vector has been modified. This allows for efficient directional cloning and results in the addition of Ser-Gly to the N-terminus of the peptide-pIII fusion. In the previously used library, the 20-mer library is located directly at the N-terminus of the fusion, and it is possible that modification of the N-terminal amino group of the peptides may disrupt cell targeting.",#TargetName H1299 cell line #TargetSynonyms unknown #TargetSource Homo sapiens (Human):9606 #TargetType Cell #TargetSequence unknown #TargetStructure unknown #TargetComments unknown

Vector (pLPA30) contained the fimH gene with a BglII linker inserted at codon position 225 and under the transcriptional control of the lac promoter. The inserted double-stranded oligonucleotides consisted of nine random codons flanked by BglII restriction sites (encoding Arg-Ser). Due to the presence of BglII overhangs, various numbers of double-stranded oligonucleotides were inserted in fimH, further adding to the complexity of the library. To express FimH variants as constituents of fimbriae, an auxiliary plasmid (pKKL115), containing all fim genes except fimH, was used for transcomplementation of the fimH-containing plasmid. Expression from the binary plasmid system led to display of chimeric FimH in the context of fully functional fimbriae.","#TargetName Zinc ion, Zn(2+) #TargetSynonyms unknown #TargetSource None #TargetType Inorganic molecules or materials #TargetSequence unknown #TargetStructure unknown #TargetComments unknown"

Belcher #LibrarySeqLength 8 #LibraryComplexity unknown #LibraryTiter unknown #LibraryRandomness Completely random #LibraryCodingScheme NNM #LibraryTopology Linear #LibraryComments The M13KE phage vector was modified by making a cloning site for pVIII display. A Pst I restriction site was made by mutating T to A at position 1372, a BamH I site was made by mutating C to G at positon 1381, and the Pst I site at position 6246 was deleted by mutating T to A at position 6250. The site-directed mutagenesis was done using overlap extension PCR. A dsDNA library was then prepared and cloned into the resulting modified phage vector, named M13SK, using Pst I and BamH I. To obtain the dsDNA library, partial library duplexes were formed by annealing of extension primer (5\'-GATGCTGTCTTTCGCTGCAG-3\') with oligonucleotides (3\'-ACGACAGAAAGCGACGTCnm(nnm)6nnCCTAGGAACATC ATC-5\', where n=A, T, C, or G and m=A or C). The partial library duplexes were incubated with Klenow fragment (3\'→'5\' exo-) (10 U/μL) and dNTP at 37 °C for 30 min. The Klenow fragment was inactivated by heating (75 °C for 20 min), and the mixture was digested with Pst I and BamH I. The digested DNA was gel purified (2-40% TBE polyacrylamide gel), ligated into M13SK, and transfected to XL1-Blue Electroporation Competent Cells using a MicroPulser (Biorad). The library was titered according to manufacturer directions and sequenced (MIT Biopolymers Laboratory) before amplification.","#TargetName Iridium oxide, IrO2 #TargetSynonyms unknown #TargetSource None #TargetType Inorganic molecules or materials #TargetSequence unknown #TargetStructure unknown #TargetComments unknown"

A dimer of E2 interacts with a dimer of E1 in order to improve specificity of E1 DNA binding activity. Once the complex recognizes and binds DNA at specific sites, the E2 dimer is removed from DNA. E2 also regulates viral transcription through binding to the E2RE response element (5'-ACCNNNNNNGGT-3') present in multiple copies in the regulatory regions of the viral genome. Activates or represses transcription depending on E2RE's position with regards to proximal promoter elements including the TATA-box. Repression occurs by sterically hindering the assembly of the transcription initiation complex."

FUSE-5 replicative Form DNA was purified from K802 Escherichia coli and linearized by SfiI digestion, and the resulting vector DNA was ligated to synthetic DNA fragments containing complementary BglI termini. These duplex oligonucleotides contained (NNM)15 triplets in the coding strand, where N corresponds to equivalent amounts of A, T, G, and C and where M corresponds to equivalent amounts of G and T (minimizes occurrence of translational stop codons). The noncoding strand consisted of 18 or 45 residue stretches of the inosine nucleotide analog. Recombinant DNA was electroporated into MC1061 E. coli electrocompetent cells, spread on 94 plates (24 x 24 cm) with NZamine-yeast extract (NZY) agar plus 40 μg/ml tetracycline (tet) and incubated overnight at 37 °C.

All of the cyclic peptide libraries (TN6-6, TN10-9, and TN12-1) were constructed in same manner, i.e. in a derivative of M13mp18, MANP, having the following modifications: bla (AmpR) gene, modified junction between signal of iii and coding region for mature III, and removal of LacZ complementation system. MANP comprises 8164 bases. The bla gene was from pGEM3Zf1(+), was bound by BamHI-HindIII sites at the 5' end and HindIII-SalI sites at the 3' end, replaced bases 6001 through 6432 of M13mp18, and was in the same orientation as the phage genes. The junction between the III signal sequence and mature III was modified with an NcoI restriction site embedded in the last three codons of the signal sequence. After the III signal, MANP contained the sequence of BPTI with restriction sites for the enzymes StyI, XhoI, PflMI, ApaI, Bsp120I, EcoO109I, PspOMI, BssHII, StuI, BstZ17I, BlpI, EagI, and SphI, which were all unique within MANP. Following BPTI, a unique PstI site and a Factor Xa cleavage site were inserted in a short linker region before mature III. The DNA encoding the library was synthesized with constant DNA on either side so that the DNA could be PCR amplified using TAQ DNA polymerase, cleaved with NcoI and PstI, and ligated to similarly cleaved vector. The variegated parts were synthesized with TRIM technology, which incorporates trinucleotides and allows mixtures of any set of amino acid types in any desired proportions. The flanking and varied DNA sequence positions of TN10-9 phage library is depicted as ""AEGTGS-X1X1X2 CX3X3X3X3X3X3X3X3C X2X1X1-APGPTDS"", where X1 belongs to any residue of DFHLNPRSWY, X2 denotes any residue of ADFGHLNPQRSVWY, and X3 is any natural amino acids except cysteine.

Belcher #LibrarySeqLength 8 #LibraryComplexity unknown #LibraryTiter unknown #LibraryRandomness Completely random #LibraryCodingScheme NNM #LibraryTopology Linear #LibraryComments The M13KE phage vector was modified by making a cloning site for pVIII display. A Pst I restriction site was made by mutating T to A at position 1372, a BamH I site was made by mutating C to G at positon 1381, and the Pst I site at position 6246 was deleted by mutating T to A at position 6250. The site-directed mutagenesis was done using overlap extension PCR. A dsDNA library was then prepared and cloned into the resulting modified phage vector, named M13SK, using Pst I and BamH I. To obtain the dsDNA library, partial library duplexes were formed by annealing of extension primer (5\'-GATGCTGTCTTTCGCTGCAG-3\') with oligonucleotides (3\'-ACGACAGAAAGCGACGTCnm(nnm)6nnCCTAGGAACATC ATC-5\', where n=A, T, C, or G and m=A or C). The partial library duplexes were incubated with Klenow fragment (3\'→'5\' exo-) (10 U/μL) and dNTP at 37 °C for 30 min. The Klenow fragment was inactivated by heating (75 °C for 20 min), and the mixture was digested with Pst I and BamH I. The digested DNA was gel purified (2-40% TBE polyacrylamide gel), ligated into M13SK, and transfected to XL1-Blue Electroporation Competent Cells using a MicroPulser (Biorad). The library was titered according to manufacturer directions and sequenced (MIT Biopolymers Laboratory) before amplification.","#TargetName Cobalt ion, Co(2+) #TargetSynonyms unknown #TargetSource None #TargetType Inorganic molecules or materials #TargetSequence unknown #TargetStructure unknown #TargetComments unknown"

It uses cytoplasmic anions as extrinsic voltage sensors, probably chloride and bicarbonate. After binding to a site with millimolar affinity, these anions are translocated across the membrane in response to changes in the transmembrane voltage. They move towards the extracellular surface following hyperpolarization, and towards the cytoplasmic side in response to depolarization. As a consequence, this translocation triggers conformational changes in the protein that ultimately alter its surface area in the plane of the plasma membrane."

The chemical works by interfering with the transmission of stimuli in the insect nervous system. Specifically, it causes a blockage in the nicotinergic neuronal pathway. This blockage leads to the accumulation of acetylcholine, an important neurotransmitter, resulting in the insect's paralysis, and eventually death. It is effective on contact and via stomach action."

In the cyclic library, the spacing of the cysteine residues varied from three to six residues. The randomization of residues for both libraries was achieved using Kunkel mutagenesis, employing degenerate oligonucleotides in which each randomized residue was encoded by an NNS codon. Equal aliquots of each linear and cyclic sublibrary were combined, giving rise to the 8-residue pool for panning.",#TargetName Anti-LeY antigen monoclonal antibody B3 #TargetSynonyms unknown #TargetSource Unknown #TargetType Protein>Monoclonal antibody #TargetSequence unknown #TargetStructure unknown #TargetComments unknown

Using the poly-merase chain reaction (PCR), the pIII signal sequence cleavage site and N terminus of pIII were replaced with a new cloning site composed of a XhoI site and BamHI site flanking an amber stop codon. Recombinants have a sin-gle serine residue fixed at the N terminus of the mature pIII protein to ensure minimal bias during signal sequence cleavage, and a (Gly-Ser)4 spacer between the peptide and full-length pIII protein.

EC=3.4.21.77 #TargetSource Homo sapiens (Human):9606 #TargetType Protein>Enzyme #TargetSequence P07288 #TargetStructure 2ZCH, 2ZCK, 2ZCL, 3QUM #TargetComments PSA is a serine protease (-Tyr-|-Xaa-) produced almost exclusively by the prostate gland. It hydrolyze semenogelin-1, leading to the liquefaction of the seminal coagulum, which allows sperm to swim freely. PSA is present in small quantities in the serum of men with healthy prostates, but is often elevated in the presence of prostate cancer and in other prostate disorders."

Diseases caused by P. capsici are polycyclic in that multiple cycles of infection and inoculum production occur in a single growing season. The pathogen survives unfavorable conditions in soil by forming thickwalled oospores, while dissemination and infection are achieved through the production of motile biflagellate zoospores from oospores. The zoospores swim through water in the soil and are chemotactically attracted to the exudates released by the roots of potential host plants. After the zoospores have adhered to the root surface, they encyst and produce a precisely oriented germ tube that grows into adjacent host plant tissue."

For the Ph.D.-C7C disulfide-constrained library, the randomized sequence is preceded by Ala-Cys at the N-terminus. Each displayed peptide is followed by a short spacer (Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser) and then the wild-type pIII sequence. The display vector used for the library is a derivative of wild-type M13 phage-simple propagation of the library as phage rather than plasmid eliminates the need for antibiotic selection and a separate helper phage superinfection step, saving time and effort.

The ligated left carotid artery is the target for phage display, while the right artery serves as a normal flow control."

Takenaka #LibrarySeqLength 6 #LibraryComplexity 8.6e8 #LibraryTiter 2.5e13 #LibraryRandomness Completely random #LibraryCodingScheme NNM #LibraryTopology Linear #LibraryComments The 6-mer phage display random peptide library was constructed using the fUSE-5 vector, kindly provided by G. Smith (University of Missouri). FUSE-5 replicative Form DNA was purified from K802 Escherichia coli and linearized by SfiI digestion, and the resulting vector DNA was ligated to synthetic DNA fragments containing complementary BglI termini. These duplex oligonucleotides contained (NNM)6 triplets in the coding strand, where N corresponds to equivalent amounts of A, T, G, and C and where M corresponds to equivalent amounts of G and T (minimizes occurrence of translational stop codons). The noncoding strand consisted of 18 or 45 residue stretches of the inosine nucleotide analog.

Smith (University of Missouri). FUSE-5 replicative Form DNA was purified from K802 Escherichia coli and linearized by SfiI digestion, and the resulting vector DNA was ligated to synthetic DNA fragments containing complementary BglI termini. These duplex oligonucleotides contained (NNM)6 triplets in the coding strand, where N corresponds to equivalent amounts of A, T, G, and C and where M corresponds to equivalent amounts of G and T (minimizes occurrence of translational stop codons). The noncoding strand consisted of 18 or 45 residue stretches of the inosine nucleotide analog.

To add hexameric amino acid sequences to the C-terminal of the G10 protein of T7 phage through the GGGS linker peptide, a template oligonucleotide (5'-GCCGCAAGCTTTTATCCMNNMNNMNNMNNMNNMNNCGAACCTCCACCTGAATTCGG-3') was synthesized. This oligonucleotide was amplified by PCR using forward and reverse primers (5'-CCGAATTCAGGTGGAGG-3'and 5'-CGGCGTTCGAAAATAGG-3') that harbored restriction sites for EcoRI and HindIII, respectively. The generated PCR product was purified on a PCR-M column (Viogene) and digested with EcoRI and HindIII. The DNA fragment was purified on a PCR-M column again and ligated into the corresponding restriction sites in the T7Select415 vector. The ligation mixture was subjected to anin vitro packaging reaction using a T7 packaging extract (Novagen).

The peptide-coding sequences were assembled from trimeric nucleotide building blocks, so that each naturally occurring amino acid (with the exception of cysteine) was encoded with equal probability at each of the 16 amino acid positions. This approach alleviates the risk of introducing unwanted stop codons. The 12-mer peptide library consisted of 1.0e11 unique peptides fused to M13 minor coat protein p3. The peptide-coding sequence was assembled from 12 consecutive repetitions of “NNK” codons (where N represents all four nucleotides and K represents guanine or thymine).",#TargetName Kappa fractions mixture of polyclonal immunoglobulin G(IgG) of multiplemyeloma patient MM023 and MM031 and MM041 #TargetSynonyms unknown #TargetSource Homo sapiens (Human):9606 #TargetType Protein>Polyclonal antibody #TargetSequence unknown #TargetStructure unknown #TargetComments unknown

A double-stranded randomized insert was created using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), double-digested with SfiI/NotI (New England Biolabs) and cloned into SfiI/NotI-digested pIGT2 phagemid vectors (Ig Therapy Co.). The resulting construct was electroporated into electrocompetent E. coli XL1 cells (Stratagene), and the transformed cells were infected with Ex12 mutant helper phage (Ig Therapy Co.) for amplification of the aptide-displaying phage library.

Each peptide has two cysteines at fixed positions 5 residues apart within the otherwise randomized amino acids, and thus is potentially constrained conformationally by a disulfide bond. The random amino acids are specified by degenerate codons in a synthetic oligonucleotide insert, which was spliced into vector f88-4 between its HindIII and PstI cloning sites in recombinant gene rVIII. The resulting recombinant, insert-bearing rVIII-Cys5 gene, encoding recombinant protein rpVIII-Cys5, is inducible by IPTG.
